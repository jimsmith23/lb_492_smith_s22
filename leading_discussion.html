Your team will briefly summarizea paper (or set of papers), help the class generate a set ofquestions in class that will set the stage for our discussion thatday, and then initiate the class discussion.</P><P>Your team's preparation, summary of the readings, and setting thestage for discussion will be worth 50 points towards your finalcourse grade.</P><P><A HREF="discussion_schedule.html"><B>DiscussionSchedule</B></A></P><P>The link above shows the scheduled student-facilitated classdiscussions for our Senior Seminar this semester.</P><P><B><I>Roles and Responsibilities.</I> </B>The first role the teamneeds to fulfill is that of the Summarizer. One student will take thelead to summarize the readings for that day's discussion and put theminto the context of our overall class topics and activities.Summarizers should address in their presentations the following threeitems:</P><BLOCKQUOTE>i. What is the medical problem/syndrome addressed?<BR>   ii. How do evolutionary principles come into play in this set of   readings?<BR>   iii. What is the standard treatment perspective, and how could an   evolutionary perspective on care improve it?</BLOCKQUOTE><P>The second role that the team needs to fulfill is that ofdiscussion leader. A major part of fulfilling this role is helping togenerate a set of discussion the presentations is for students tohelp the class develop questions with which we can initiate ourdiscussion. For example, point out dichotomies, or points ofconflict, brought out by the readings. In your presentation, be sureto relate the reading to your own previous coursework and personalexperiences!!</P><P><B>Scoring Rubric for Presentation #1</B></P><P>Student presentations will be graded as follows:</P><BLOCKQUOTE>i. Preparation (15 pts.); How well did your team prepare   for the class session in which you led the class discussion?      <P>ii. Summary (20 pts); How well (and succinctly) did the student   pair summarize and present the content of the reading(s)? How well   did the student pair capture the science behind the discussion   papers? How well does the student pair make the connection of the   reading to the topic of Evolutionary Medicine? How well does the   student pair connect the topic to an HPS theme?</P>      <P>iii. Getting the Discussion Going (15 pts.); How well did your   team generate discussion questions from the class and use these as   a basis to begin the discussion?</P></BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><FONT FACE="Times"><HR></FONT>&nbsp;<CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><FONT FACE="Arial"><IMG SRC="graphics/hank.jpg" WIDTH=114 HEIGHT=74 ALIGN=bottom></FONT></A><BR><A HREF=" index.html"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>back to LB492 S22Homepage</B></FONT></A></P></CENTER><P><HR></P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000">Last Updated Jan. 10, 2022(JS)<BR></FONT></CENTER><P><FONT FACE="Times">&nbsp;</FONT></P></BODY></HTML>
