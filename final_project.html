In addition to providing a summary and overview of your final researched essay, your proposal should do the      following:</B>            <UL>         <LI><B>State what your topic is, as specifically as         possible.</B></LI>                  <LI><B>List what question(s) you will attempt to answer in         the paper.</B></LI>                  <LI><B>Name the kinds of sources you will use and discuss         how you will use them.</B></LI>                  <LI><B>Explain why this is a Capstone Senior Seminar         paper.</B></LI>                  <LI><B>Explain why this is an original critical         analysis.</B></LI>      </UL>            <P><B>b. You will need to have read a number of your intended      sources in order to write your proposal. You will certainly      find that you will need to add extra sources as you complete your      researched essay project.</B></P>            <P><B>c. Give the researched essay project a tentative title,      and put that title at the top of your proposal.</B></P>            <P><B>d. You may write about your paper in the present tense or      in the future tense for purposes of the proposal. I recommend      the present tense.</B></P>            <P><B>e. The following link is to a </B><A HREF="proposal.html"><B>sample      proposal</B></A><B> (written by former LBC HPS Prof. Alice      Dreger).

Proposals are due by Tuesday March 29, 2022. Submission      should be via D2L, and early submission is encouraged.
