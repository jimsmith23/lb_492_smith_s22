This paper   should address a topic derived or connected to the the issues and   ideas discussed in our seminar. Students should examine their   topic from multiple perspectives (e.g. the natural sciences, the   social sciences, the humanities) </B></P>      <P><B>2. The Proposal (10 Points); due Monday March 27,   2017</B></P>      <P><B>Your proposal should be 1.5-3.0 pages long (double-spaced,   one inch margins) and should lay out what you plan to do in your   researched essay.</B></P>      <BLOCKQUOTE><B>a. Your proposal should do all of the      following:</B>            <UL>         <LI><B>State what your topic is, as specifically as         possible.</B></LI>                  <LI><B>List what question(s) you will attempt to answer in         the paper.</B></LI>                  <LI><B>Name the kinds of sources you will use and discuss         how you will use them.</B></LI>                  <LI><B>Explain why this is a Capstone Senior Seminar         paper.</B></LI>                  <LI><B>Explain why this is an original critical         analysis.</B></LI>      </UL>            <P><B>b. You will need to have read many of your intended      sources in order to write your proposal. You will certainly      find that you need to add extra sources as you complete your      researched essay project.</B></P>            <P><B>c. Give the researched essay project a tentative title,      and put that title at the top of your proposal.</B></P>            <P><B>d. You may write about your paper in the present tense or      in the future tense for purposes of the proposal. I recommend      the present tense.</B></P>            <P><B>e. The following link is to a </B><A HREF="proposal.html"><B>sample      proposal</B></A><B> (written by former LBC HPS Prof. Alice      Dreger). You do not need to lay out your proposal exactly as it      is here. You should organize your proposal in a way that makes      sense for your project. </B></P>            <P><B>f. Proposals are due by Monday March 27, 2017. Submission      should be electronic, and early submission is encouraged. I      will examine submitted proposals and hold individual      conferences with students as necessary (and as      desired).</B>&nbsp;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>      <P><B>3.

Instructions for preparation of the Annotated   Bibliography:</B></P>      <UL>      <LI><B>Your bibliography should include at least 7 sources (see      me if you need an exception to this rule) arranged      alphabetically, and should be annotated. You may name more than      seven sources in your annotated bibliography. If you are      planning to use fewer than seven, you must check with me at      least two days in advance. </B></LI>            <LI><B>You can use websites as sources. However, I expect at      least 5 of your sources to come from the MSU library      collections. These do not include reference works (i.e.      encyclopedias).</B></LI>            <LI><B>Each entry in your bibliography should be annotated. In      other words, you should state in 2-5 sentences how you will use      that particular source in your researched essay. (See the      sample.)</B></LI>            <LI><B>Note that, for your bibliography, you should      consistently use one of the citation systems APA or MLA.      </B></LI>            <LI><B>Your Annotated Bibliography is due with the final paper      on May 1, 2017</B></LI>            <LI><B>The following link is to a </B><A HREF="annotated_bibliography.html"><B>sample      annotated bibliography</B></A><B> (written by Alice Dreger).      </B></LI>   </UL>      <P><B>4.

Overview</B></P>      <P><B>On April 17 we will have a peer editing session on drafts of   your final papers. Students will be asked to assess how well their   classmates have integrated the various elements of their project   (i.e. proposal and annotated biblio) into their final papers. The   peer review sheets and peer reviewed drafts will be turned in with   the final paper and will be graded. Draft will be worth 10 points   (showing up with an editable draft) and your performance as a peer   reviewer will be worth 10 points.</B></P>      <P><B>b.
