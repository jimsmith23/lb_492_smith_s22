Todaymany medical professionals, especially U.S. surgeons, appear willingto take great risks in order to separate conjoined ("Siamese")twins.&nbsp; Some surgical separations are fairly simple and can beperformed with little risk to the twins.&nbsp; But an increasingnumber of doctors are willing to attempt separations even if theseparation is highly likely to leave twins brain-damaged, immobile,badly scarred, without reproductive capabilities they once had, witha sex-change, or even dead.&nbsp; In fact, more and more surgeons arewilling to perform "sacrifice" surgeries in which the surgeonsintentionally asphyxiate one of two conscious conjoined twins.&nbsp;In no other realm of medicine can doctors legally or ethically inducebrain-death in a brain-live person without that person's explicitconsent.</P><P class=MsoNormal style="text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;</P><P class=MsoNormal style="text-indent:.5in">&#91;THEN I STATE MY"BURNING QUESTION" FOR THIS PAPER:&#93;&nbsp; How did thisunparalleled type of medical treatment arise, and why is it ethicallywrong?</P><P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P><P class=MsoNormal>&#91;NOW I MORE CLEARLY SPECIFY MYTOPIC:&#93;&nbsp; In this paper I review the history of the socialand medical treatment of conjoined twins, and I demonstrate thattoday's medical treatment of conjoined twins reflects thelong-standing and extremely negative social attitudes towardsconjoined twins.&nbsp; Specifically the social attitude has been thatconjoined twinning is monstrous, and the medical treatment has actedas if that is so; conjoined twins have been subjected to medicalprocedures not normally applied to humans, and in effect they havebeen treated as monstrous or not fully human.&nbsp; In this paper Iargue that this is ethically wrong.</P><P class=MsoNormal style="text-indent:.5in">&nbsp;</P><P class=MsoNormal style="text-indent:.5in">&#91;I EXPLAIN WHY THISIS AN HPS TOPIC:&#93; This is an HPS paper because I show how thesocial realms (social attitudes towards the abnormal) have influencedmedical professionals to treat a naturally occurring human variation(conjoined twinning) in a particularly negative way.&nbsp; Idocument, analyze, and critique this system.&nbsp; I am addressingthe themes of "questions of authority" (who counts as an authority,medical professionals or conjoined twins themselves), "culturalinfluences on medicine and medicine's influence on culture" and"theory-ladenness of observation" (how observations of conjoinedtwins are shaped by beliefs about what counts as normal).</P><P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P><P class=MsoNormal>&#91;I EXPLAIN WHY THIS IS A LEVEL-4PAPER:&#93;&nbsp; Other people have written about the biology ofconjoined twinning and about the personal lives of conjoinedtwins.&nbsp; They have also discussed some of the ethical problemsassociated with the cost of conjoined twin separations.&nbsp; But I'mgoing beyond all approaches these to a new level:&nbsp; I am arguingin this paper that "sacrifice" separations of conjoined twins arefundamentally based on profoundly negative social attitudes.&nbsp; Iargue that "sacrifice" surgeries are wrong.&nbsp; I show that twinswho remain conjoined can live fulfilling lives, and moreover thatthey are fully human and therefore deserving of being treated withthe same ethical and legal standards as everyone else.In this paperto make my argument I am using my own ideas about what it means to behuman and what medicine should and shouldn't aim to do.</P><P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P><P class=MsoNormal>&#91;DISCUSSION OF MY SOURCES:&#93;&nbsp; To setup my main argument (that conjoined twins should be treated accordingto the same ethical principles as everyone else and that sacrificesurgeries are wrong) I have to present my reader with factualhistorical information which shows two things: first, that the socialand medical treatment of conjoined twins has often been harmful andde-humanizing; second, that conjoined twins themselves have managedto live rewarding, meaningful lives.&nbsp; To do this, I useinformation I have gathered from biographies of conjoinedtwins.&nbsp; I also use historical articles and books which discussthe history of cultural attitudes towards "freaks."&nbsp; I show thereader of my paper that conjoined twins have often been treated as"freaks" but that this is a bigoted and unjustifiedattitude.&nbsp;</P><P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P><P class=MsoNormal>&#91;MORE ABOUT MY SOURCES AND HOW I USETHEM:&#93;&nbsp; Since this paper is primarily about the medicaltreatment of conjoined twins, I have to take a close look at themedical treatment of conjoined twins.&nbsp; Therefore in this paper Ialso use information gleaned from history of medicine texts and fromreports published in medical journals by the surgeonsthemselves.&nbsp; Using these texts I show how the medical approachconsistently treats conjoined twinning as an impossible way to live,something disproved by the biographies of conjoined twinsthemselves.&nbsp; I also use the medical record to show that"sacrifice" surgeries involve the intentional killing of a consciousperson.</P><P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P><P class=MsoNormal>&#91;MORE ABOUT MY SOURCES AND HOW I USETHEM:&#93;&nbsp; In order to show that my ethical analysis is uniqueand original, I have to review what other ethical analyses ofseparations surgeries have said.In my review of ethics papers, I showthat other authors have <U>not</U> recognized that (1) conjoinedtwins often describe their lives as normal and meaningful, and (2)conjoined twins must be accorded the same ethical and legalprotections as everyone else.</P><P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P><P class=MsoNormal><B>REMEMBER:</B> You do not need to lay out yourprospectus exactly as I have here.
