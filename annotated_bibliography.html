Your bibliography should include at least six primary literature sources (see      me if you need an exception to this rule) arranged      alphabetically, and should be annotated. You may list more than      six sources in your annotated bibliography.</P><P class=MsoNormal style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .25in">2.Each entry in your bibliography should be annotated. In      other words, you should state in 2-5 sentences how you will use      that particular source in your researched essay. (See the      sample.)</P><P class=MsoNormal style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .25in">3.
