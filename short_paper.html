of your choice from an Evolutionary Medicine perspective. The main feature of your "entry" will be 
the description, application, and synthesis of two or more of the core concepts of Evolutionary Medicine 
shown in the list below. In addition to providing the firstchance for you to write formally for the course, this exercise will give you a chanceto wrap your head around some core concepts and explore how they apply to a subject you find to be of interest. 
This short writing exercise also provides a mechanism for students to engage with Nesse and Williams' book, <i>Why We Get Sick,</i>, and from there the primary literature.</P><P><B>Required Elements</B></P><P>There are six core evolutionary medicine concepts that you can choose from to explore in this paper.
At a minimum, choose two of these for use in your "entry". These are:</P><UL>   <LI>Life History and Trade-offs</LI>      <LI>Phylogeny and the Tree of Life</LI>      <LI>Antagonistic Pleiotropy</LI>
   <LI>Proximate and Ultimate Evolutionary Explanations</LI>      <LI>Environmental Mismatch</LI>      <LI>Mutations and Mutation Load</LI>   </UL><P>Your entry should consist of the following:</P><P><B><I>1. The Health Phenomenon.</I></B> What is the human health problem/phenomenon that you are describing? 
(If you are struggling to find a phenomenon, look through WWGS. There are tons!)
As an example, I might choose "opioid addiction".
In this case, I would spend some time describing for my readers what opioid addiction is, its biological and HPS dimensions
 (e.g., how much of a problem it is societally)
and other aspects of opioid addiction that I find worth mentioning.
</P><P><B><I>2. Evolutionary Medicine Concepts - Defined.</I></B> In this section, youshould introduce the reader to the specific evolutionary medicine concepts andprinciples listed above that you will be applying to your health problem/phenomenon. For each one, describe what it is,
how it works/what it entails, and provide an example of its operation <i>in a system that is NOT the one you are using for your Wikipedia
entry!</i></P><P><B><I>3. Evolutionary Medicine Concepts - Applied and Synthesized.</I></B> Following your descriptions above, youshould next describe for the reader the explicit connection(s) between thephenomenon you are studying and your evolutionary medicine concepts. The best entries will not only make connections of the concepts
to the phenomena, but will point out relationships and connections between the evolutionary medicine concepts themselves. </P><P><B><I>4. References Cited section. </I></B>We expect that yourpaper will include 6-10 books and/or primary literature sources,although some students may need more. Use either MLA or APA (mypreferred format) style and guidelines for your references.</P><P><B>Schedule and Points</B></P><P>We will outline our 'Entries" in class on Tues. Feb. 1st, followedby a session in class on Tues. Feb. 8th in which we Peer Edit draftsof our entries. The final drafts will be due on Tues. Feb. 15th.</P><P>The Wikipedia Entry is worth 50 points total.</P><P>Due Monday Feb. 1st - Outline (5 points)</P><P>Due Monday Feb. 8th - Draft for Peer Review (5 points for draft,10 points for Peer Review)</P><P>Due Monday Feb. 15th - Final Draft (30 points)</P><P><HR></P><CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><FONT FACE="Arial"><IMG SRC="graphics/hank.jpg" WIDTH=114 HEIGHT=72 ALIGN=bottom></FONT></A><P><A HREF="index.html"><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial"><B>back to LB492Homepage</B></FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>&nbsp;<HR><BR></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">This page lastupdated January 17, 2022 (JS)</FONT></P><P></P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
