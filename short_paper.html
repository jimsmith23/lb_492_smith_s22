In addition to providing the firstchance for you to write formally for the course, our goals inassigning this exercise are to orient students to topics inevolutionary medicine that are currently being researched, and toprovide a mechanism for students to engage with the course textbookand, from there, the primary literature.</P><P>There are four possible research areas where funding lookspromising, and each student should choose one of these topic areasfor their research proposal. These topic areas are:</P><UL>   <LI>Ageing and Senescence</LI>      <LI>Evolution of Infectious Disease</LI>      <LI>Autoimmune Disease and Allergy</LI>      <LI>Cancer</LI></UL><P><B>Required Elements of the Proposal</B></P><P>The proposal should consist of the following sections:</P><P><B><I>1. Title Page and Project Summary.</I></B> Give yourproposal a title and put your name on it. Then, briefly descibe yourproposed work (one paragraph), including why your proposal hasintellectual merit. In addition, include in your Project Summary anexplicit statement indicating the broader impacts of your proposedreaearch. In other words, how will your work benefit others outsideof your research group.</P><P><B><I>2. A Project Description.</I></B> In this section, youshould introduce the reader to your topic and provide some backgroundon what is known about the research question you seek to address. Usethe sections of Gluckman et al.'s <I>Principles of EvolutionaryMedicine</I> 2nd Ed. listed below as starting points for yourresearch. Then, use the references cited within that section ofGluckman et al. to gain access to literature relevant to yourproposal. Be sure also to indicate why yours is an evolutionarymedicine topic, including an explicit connection between thephenomenon you are studying and specific evolutionary concepts andprinciples.</P><P><TABLE BORDER=1>   <TR>      <TD>         <P>Ageing and Senescence</P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P>Ch. 5, pp. 97-107</P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD>         <P>Evolution of Infectious Disease</P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P>Ch. 10, pp. 240-244</P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD>         <P>Autoimmune Disease and Allergy</P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P>Ch. 10, pp. 245-252</P>      </TD>   </TR>   <TR>      <TD>         <P>Cancer</P>      </TD>      <TD>         <P>Ch. 12. pp. 287-302</P>      </TD>   </TR></TABLE><BR>You should next indicate the hypothesis you are testing in yourresearch and the associated specific research question(s) that youwill address. For example, I may want to test the hypothesis thatconstant exposure to freeway traffic noise leads to higher levels ofschizophrenia. A specific research question I might ask is whetherpeople who currently live closer to freeways have higher levels ofschizophrenia.</P><P>Finally, indicate how you will carry out your research. Whatactivities will you do to answer your research question(s) and testyour hypothesis? Be sure to include how you will interpret theresults of data that you collect. For this part of the ProjectDescription, I anticipate that you will be guided by the methodsemployed by other scientists in papers that you consult for yourproject.</P><P><B><I>3. A References Cited section. </I></B>We expect that yourpaper will include 6-10 books and/or primary literature sources,although some students may need more. Use either MLA or APA (mypreferred format) style and guidelines for your references.</P><P><B>Schedule and Points</B></P><P>We will outline our proposals in class on Mon. Jan. 30th, followedby a session in class on Mon. Feb. 6th in which we Peer Edit draftsof our proposals. The final drafts will be due on Mon. Feb. 13th.</P><P>The proposal is worth 50 points total.</P><P>Due Monday Jan. 30th - Outline (5 points)</P><P>Due Monday Feb. 6th - Draft for Peer Review (5 points for draft,10 points for Peer Review)</P><P>Due Monday Feb. 13th - Final Draft (30 points)</P><P><HR></P><CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><FONT FACE="Arial"><IMG SRC="graphics/superbug.jpg" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=82 ALIGN=bottom></FONT></A><P><A HREF="index.html"><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial"><B>back to LB492Homepage</B></FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>&nbsp;<HR><BR></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">This page lastupdated January 16, 2017 (JS)</FONT></P><P></P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
